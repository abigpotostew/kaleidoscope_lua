### kaleidoscope_lua
#### By Stewart Bracken

A project script for OpenFrameworks, using my fork of the ofxLua addon: https://github.com/abigpotostew/ofxLua/.

This is neat because you can run this same kaleidoscope.lua script on a mac, pc, linux, or raspberry pi and it should all work the same without compiling. I've tested this on Mac OS and raspberry pi only.

Place this inside the data folder of your openframeworks app. Use my Luafy program (https://github.com/abigpotostew/Luafy) for running this on Mac and my luaPi program for running this on Raspberry Pi / Linux.
